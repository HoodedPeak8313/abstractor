# Some quick tips:

### REQUIREMENTS:





**Open a terminal/command prompt window in the file director of *requirements.txt* and do "*pip install -r requirements.txt*" without quotes.**





### **-- How to use --**


> There are four values that you can fill in:
>
> - Length: I find it best to leave this blank so the default value 0.1 gets used. This value takes a floating point number, and no commas will be used. Example input: 2.4 ***OR* an integer** 1
> - Depth: I tend to use 10,000 to 20,000 but depending on your machine this may cause lag. The default depth is 3,000. This value takes an integer, meaning no decimals, and no commas will be used. Example input: 5000
> - Angles: This is the coolest and most varying part. It takes values anywhere from 0-360. Going past 360 causes it to loop back to 1. This takes many floating point numbers separated by commas. Example input: 30,40,60,23.333,9
> - Zoom: I find it best to leave this blank because you can use the zoom function to zoom in to somewhere specific. Nonetheless, this value takes a floating point number. Example input: 3.5

> Click the "Create" button to create your drawing.
>
> You can also save and load *snapshots*!
> Simply click the "Open a Snapshot" button and load up a .snap file that is either your own or another's.

### ***Keyboard Shortcuts***

  

> *Press **=** to zoom in.*
> *Press **-** to zoom out.*
>
> *Use the **arrow keys** to move around the screen.*
> *Press the letter **U** to move faster.*
> *Press the letter **D** to move slower.*
> *Press the letter **R** to reset the move speed.*
>
> *Press the number **0** to reset the zoom and position.*
> *Press the letter **C** to reset the position.*
> *Press the letter **O** to reset the zoom.*
>
> *Press the letter **S** to save a snapshot of the current screen.*

  

### My reasoning for the keys I chose (to help you remember)

  

> *The keys **=** and **-** just make sense to me for zooming because you are going in and out.*
>
> *The **arrow keys** point in the direction of movement.*
>
> *The letter key **U** stands for "up" because you are making the rate of movement go up.*
> *The letter key **D** stands for "down" because you are making the rate of movement go down.*
> *The letter key **R** stands for "reset" because you are resetting the movement speed.*
>
> *The number key **0** reminds me of the phrase "zeroing in" which seemed fitting for the key's function.*
*The letter key **C** stands for "center" because you are resetting the position to the center.*
*The letter key **O** stands for "out" because you are zooming out, which, I admit, does not fit in all cases considering you may already be zoomed out.*

*The letter key **S** stands for "save" because it saves a snapshot of the current screen*
